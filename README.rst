Introduction
------------

This is a micro-frontend application responsible for the display of an authenticated user's order history.

Installation
------------

This MFE is bundled with `Devstack <https://github.com/openedx/devstack>`_, see the `Getting Started <https://github.com/openedx/devstack#getting-started>`_ section for setup instructions.

1. Install Devstack using the `Getting Started <https://github.com/openedx/devstack#getting-started>`_ instructions.

2. Start up Devstack, if it's not already started.

3. Log in to Devstack (http://localhost:18000/login )

4. Within this project, install requirements and start the development server:

   .. code-block::

      npm ci
      npm start # The server will run on port 1996

   Note: We prefer ``npm ci`` over ``npm install`` to match the way CI and production builds work and avoid unintentional changes to ``package-lock.json`` when doing other work.  Note, however, that using ``npm ci`` can obscure necessary updates to ``package-lock.json`` that may have accidentally been left out of prior commits.  If ``npm install`` changes ``package-lock.json``, those are changes that *should* be checked in.

5. Once the dev server is up, visit http://localhost:1996 to access the MFE

Environment Variables/Setup Notes
---------------------------------

This MFE is configured via environment variables supplied at build time.  All micro-frontends have a shared set of required environment variables, as documented in the Open edX Developer Guide under `Required Environment Variables <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-docs/en/latest/developers_guide/micro_frontends_in_open_edx.html#required-environment-variables>`__.

This micro-frontend has no additional required environment variables.

Known Issues
------------

None

Development Roadmap
-------------------

This MFE is currently in maintenance mode, as we have no further development planned for it.  However, if we want to pull more ecommerce interfaces out into a micro-frontend, this would be where they should live.  Note that `frontend-app-payment <https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-payment>`_ contains the checkout flow.

Anyone merging to this repository is expected to `release and monitor their changes <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RS/pages/1835106870/How+to+contribute+to+our+repositories>`__; if you are not able to do this DO NOT MERGE, please coordinate with someone who can to ensure that the changes are released.
